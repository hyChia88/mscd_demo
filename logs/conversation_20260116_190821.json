This prevents me from querying \"Floor 0\" and proceeding with the compliance audit.\n\nIf the tools were functioning correctly, I would perform the following steps:\n1. Call `get_elements_by_room(\"Floor 0\")` to retrieve all elements on Floor 0.\n2. Filter the returned elements to identify exterior walls by searching for 'Innervägg' or 'Wall' in their names.\n3. For each identified exterior wall, I would then call `get_element_details(guid)` using its unique GUID to extract its Type, Material, and Fire Rating.\n4. Finally, I would compile this information into a table with the columns: [Element Name] | [Type] | [GUID] | [Material] | [Fire Rating].\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything I can do to help resolve the tool invocation issue.",
