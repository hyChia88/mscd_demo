The error message \"NotImplementedError('StructuredTool does not support sync invocation.')\" indicates a problem with the tool's current implementation.\n\nIf the tools were functioning correctly, I would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Retrieve elements from \"Floor 0\"**: I would call `get_elements_by_room(\"Floor 0\")` to get a list of all elements located on Floor 0.\n2.  **Identify exterior walls**: From the list of elements, I would filter for those whose names contain 'Innervägg' or 'Wall' to identify potential exterior walls.\n3.  **Extract details for each wall**: For each identified wall, I would use its `guid` to call `get_element_details(guid)`. This would provide me with detailed properties, from which I would extract the 'Type', 'Material', and 'Fire Rating'.\n4.  **Compile the deliverable**: Finally, I would compile all the gathered information into a table with the columns: [Element Name] | [Type] | [GUID] | [Material] | [Fire Rating].\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to try again later, or if there's an alternative way to access this information.",
